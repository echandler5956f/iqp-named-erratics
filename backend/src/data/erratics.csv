It is precariously balanced on three smaller boulders about 3 feet in diameter that elevate it roughly 18 inches above the bedrock.","The rock's unusual balanced configuration has generated numerous theories about possible human involvement in its positioning. Some researchers have suggested it may have functioned as a natural sundial or solar calendar marker, with its orientation potentially aligned with solstice observations. The area was used by Lenape peoples for over 10,000 years.","The rock has gained attention from both geological and archaeological researchers due to its unusual balanced state and proximity to other similarly balanced stones. About 40 feet northwest are three additional boulders forming a triangle configuration, with two partially balanced on smaller stones.",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.XPrwj3iqvbku_RF-FPVwLgHaFj?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain

Measuring 44 feet wide, 22 feet high, and 12 feet long, it displays the characteristic gneissic banding and weathered surfaces typical of long-distance glacial transport.","The Lenape tribe called the boulder 'Pamackapuka,' meaning 'stone from heaven' or 'stone from the sky.' They used it as a trail marker, a location for signal fires, and as a ceremonial throne for chiefs presiding over tribal meetings. The rock served as a meeting place for inter-tribal gatherings among Native Americans.","First recorded in colonial land deeds in 1687 as 'Big Rock at Small Lots,' serving as a crucial landmark for property divisions. The Borough of Glen Rock was named after this erratic when it was incorporated in 1894. About half the boulder remained buried until 1910 when excavation for street grading revealed its full massive size. ",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.qwJabYjR5Xu5_poShd_F6AHaE8?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain

The boulder displays distinctive large white feldspar phenocrysts visible throughout its surface, confirming its non-local origin. Originally measuring 45 feet in diameter and weighing over 100 tons, the boulder was glacially transported approximately 50 miles from central New Hampshire.","The boulder became a beloved landmark and popular destination for hikers and picnickers when it resided atop Rollstone Hill. It developed such community significance that extraordinary measures were taken to preserve it when threatened by quarrying operations.","First mentioned in Fitchburg Historical Society records in 1896 when concerns were raised about quarrying encroachment. In 1929, facing imminent destruction from quarrying, the boulder was explosively dismantled and reassembled by stonemason J.

The boulder exhibits characteristic rounded contours from glacial transport and displays visible large white feldspar phenocrysts typical of Conway granite.","The boulder has been a landmark since pre-European settlement and was likely known to indigenous peoples as a significant geological feature. During colonial times, it served as a reference point for land surveys and appeared on maps drawn by Robert Erskine for George Washington during the American Revolution.","First scientifically documented in 1878 by Charles Hitchcock during his pioneering geological survey of New Hampshire. The state acquired the 17-acre site from the Kennett family in 1946, and in 1970 the National Park Service designated it as a National Natural Landmark.

Dighton Rock,41.812934,-71.110424,3.5,Crystaline Sandstone,15 thousand years,1680,"A 40-ton sandstone boulder covered with petroglyphs, located along the Taunton River in Massachusetts. The rock bears hundreds of markings including faces, animals, geometric patterns, and possible script that have sparked centuries of debate about their origins. Geological analysis indicates the boulder was transported by glacial action during the Pleistocene epoch, coming to rest in its riverbank position as ice sheets retreated.","The petroglyphs represent multiple periods of indigenous artistic expression, with the earliest markings potentially dating back 8,000 years. Various groups including the Wampanoag, Portuguese explorers, and even Vikings have been credited with the inscriptions. The rock serves as a palimpsest of cultural contact, with layers of meaning accumulated over millennia of human interaction with this glacial monument.","Documented by European colonists as early as 1680, with sketches made by numerous scholars and antiquarians. The rock was moved in 1963 to Dighton Rock State Park to protect it from industrial development and river erosion. Recent archaeological work has employed 3D scanning and photogrammetry to create detailed records of the markings before further weathering occurs.",https://newengland.com/wp-content/uploads/Dighton_Rock.jpg

Plymouth Rock,41.958068,-70.662112,2.1,Granite,20 thousand years,1620,"A glacial erratic boulder located in Plymouth, Massachusetts, traditionally identified as the landing site of the Mayflower Pilgrims in 1620. While geological evidence suggests the boulder was deposited during the last glacial period approximately 20,000 years ago, its symbolic significance in American colonial history has made it one of the most famous erratics in North America. The boulder is composed of Dedham Granodiorite, matching bedrock found 15 miles to the south.","Sacred to the Wampanoag people long before European colonization, Plymouth Rock became a powerful symbol of American origins and the Pilgrim narrative. The boulder represents both geological deep time and the compressed mythology of American founding. Its transformation from anonymous glacial deposit to national shrine illustrates how natural objects acquire cultural meaning through human interpretation and ritual practice.","First identified as the Pilgrims' landing site in 1741 by Thomas Faunce, nearly 120 years after the supposed event. The boulder was moved multiple times, broken in 1774 during an attempt to relocate it, and has been housed in various memorial structures. Modern DNA analysis of the Wampanoag community reveals continuous occupation of the region for thousands of years before European contact.",https://www.grunge.com/img/gallery/the-untold-truth-of-plymouth-rock/l-intro-1609515531.jpg
