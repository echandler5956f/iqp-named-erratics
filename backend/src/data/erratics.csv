The meteorite's extraterrestrial origin combined with its glacial repositioning creates a unique intersection of cosmic and terrestrial geological processes, making it significant to both indigenous cosmology and modern scientific understanding.", "Discovered by European-American settler Ellis Hughes in 1902, leading to a legal battle over ownership between Hughes and the Oregon Iron and Steel Company. The meteorite was eventually acquired by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, though the Grand Ronde tribes have ongoing cultural connections to it.

Hidden in a residential neighborhood, it sits in a small park maintained by Glen Acres Homeowners Association.", "Known locally as the 'Lake Stevens Monster,' this geological treasure remained relatively obscure despite its massive size until formal documentation in 2011. The boulder has attracted some climbing activity over the years and increasingly draws geological enthusiasts aware of its potential status as America's largest erratic. Its location in a 1990s subdivision reflects the intersection of suburban development with significant geological features.", "Though known to locals for decades, the erratic was first scientifically documented and measured in 2011 by Lake Stevens police officers Craig Valvick and Matt McCourt. At 11 feet taller than Madison Boulder, it is among the largest erratics in the US. The rock's composition of ancient seafloor lava subjected to metamorphism tells a complex geological story spanning 125 million years.

The boulder was transported over 400 kilometers from the Canadian Shield by the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last glacial maximum. Its imposing presence on the Alberta prairie makes it visible from great distances and has served as a landmark for countless generations.", "Sacred to the Blackfoot Confederacy, who call it 'Okotok' meaning 'rock' in Blackfoot language. Traditional stories describe it as a sleeping giant or as a piece of the sacred landscape that the Creator placed to mark important territories. The boulder represents the connection between geological and spiritual time scales, embodying the Blackfoot understanding of landscape as animated and meaningful.", "Used as a landmark by indigenous peoples for thousands of years before European contact. Early European explorers and fur traders also used it for navigation across the prairie. The town of Okotoks was named after the boulder, and it remains central to local identity. Modern geochemical analysis has traced its origins to the Athabasca region, demonstrating the immense power of glacial transport.",https://lh5.ggpht.com/-pQXiX17ptms/VOMtBecYM-I/AAAAAAAA_gA/S4qkVkfxVVg/okotoks-erratic-3%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800

Madison Boulder,43.9302,-71.16968,25.3,Placeholder rock type,12 thousand years,1970,"New Hampshire's largest glacial erratic, this 5,000-ton Placeholder rock type boulder measures 83 feet long and 37 feet high. Located in Madison, New Hampshire, the boulder was transported approximately 2 miles from its bedrock source by glacial action during the Wisconsin glaciation. Its massive size and prominent position make it one of the most impressive examples of glacial transport in New England", "Long recognized by the Abenaki people as a significant landmark in their traditional territory. The boulder's impressive scale has made it a symbol of New England's glacial heritage and the immense power of ice age forces. Modern visitors often comment on the humbling experience of standing beside such a massive object moved by natural forces, reflecting on both geological time and human temporality.", "Noted by early European settlers and featured in local folklore and early geological surveys of New Hampshire. The boulder has been protected as a state natural area since 1948, making it one of the first glacial erratics to receive formal preservation status. Recent educational programs use the boulder to teach about glacial geology and climate change, connecting past ice ages to contemporary environmental challenges.",https://i.pinimg.com/originals/18/7d/88/187d882a396a26eb03ea8a5624640b2b.jpg

Dighton Rock,41.812934,-71.110424,3.5,Crystaline Sandstone,15 thousand years,1680,"A 40-ton sandstone boulder covered with petroglyphs, located along the Taunton River in Massachusetts. The rock bears hundreds of markings including faces, animals, geometric patterns, and possible script that have sparked centuries of debate about their origins. Geological analysis indicates the boulder was transported by glacial action during the Pleistocene epoch, coming to rest in its riverbank position as ice sheets retreated.", "The petroglyphs represent multiple periods of indigenous artistic expression, with the earliest markings potentially dating back 8,000 years. Various groups including the Wampanoag, Portuguese explorers, and even Vikings have been credited with the inscriptions. The rock serves as a palimpsest of cultural contact, with layers of meaning accumulated over millennia of human interaction with this glacial monument.", "Documented by European colonists as early as 1680, with sketches made by numerous scholars and antiquarians. The rock was moved in 1963 to Dighton Rock State Park to protect it from industrial development and river erosion. Recent archaeological work has employed 3D scanning and photogrammetry to create detailed records of the markings before further weathering occurs.",https://newengland.com/wp-content/uploads/Dighton_Rock.jpg

Plymouth Rock,41.958068,-70.662112,2.1,Dedham Granodiorite,20 thousand years,1620,"A glacial erratic boulder located in Plymouth, Massachusetts, traditionally identified as the landing site of the Mayflower Pilgrims in 1620. While geological evidence suggests the boulder was deposited during the last glacial period approximately 20,000 years ago, its symbolic significance in American colonial history has made it one of the most famous erratics in North America. The boulder is composed of Dedham Granodiorite, matching bedrock found 15 miles to the south.", "Sacred to the Wampanoag people long before European colonization, Plymouth Rock became a powerful symbol of American origins and the Pilgrim narrative. The boulder represents both geological deep time and the compressed mythology of American founding. Its transformation from anonymous glacial deposit to national shrine illustrates how natural objects acquire cultural meaning through human interpretation and ritual practice.", "First identified as the Pilgrims' landing site in 1741 by Thomas Faunce, nearly 120 years after the supposed event. The boulder was moved multiple times, broken in 1774 during an attempt to relocate it, and has been housed in various memorial structures. Modern DNA analysis of the Wampanoag community reveals continuous occupation of the region for thousands of years before European contact.",https://www.grunge.com/img/gallery/the-untold-truth-of-plymouth-rock/l-intro-1609515531.jpg
